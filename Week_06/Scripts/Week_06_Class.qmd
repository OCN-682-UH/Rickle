## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Look at the data

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```
## make a plot
This is looking at relationship between *bill length* and *bill depth*

```{r}
penguins %>% ## penguin dataset visual 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
