## Introduction

Today we are learning to work with figures

## Libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Make a plot

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| out-width: "70%" ## to make it 70% of width
#| fig-align: "center" ## center on screen
#| label: fig-penguin
#| fig-cap: "This is a figure showing bill length by depth"

penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

When you look at @fig-penguin we can see a positive relationship between bill length and depth
